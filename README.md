## MySQL-Workbench  
This is desktop based application that helps you to create and manage databases in your application or in your projects.  
Some of the key features of this project are:  
  * You can create any number of databases.  
  * You can add tables to any databases.  
  * You can update the columns of the table at any time just by clicking some buttons.  
  * You can delete tables at any time.
  
The basic idea to this project to handle all the CRUD operations of DBMS without writing any query. All you need to do is press some buttons and you are good to go.  
For example, if you want to create a table then you just have to select the database and press the create table button.
